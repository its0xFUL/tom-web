        Alright, if you must know, there's going to be a bunch of stuff here soon-ish.
        E-mail is already setup. Next is installing NextCloud onto a used PC and pointing wad.isc.hm to it. Yes, it's a reference to DOOM. Because DOOM rules.
        Last thing I can think of is a URL shortener. That will come a bit later, but will definitely be a thing, since this short domain is perfect for it.
        
        Why? What's the point to all this?

        Thing is, the internet is not what it used to be. People used to make stuff, code terribly looking (but all the more unique!) blogs, image galleries, flash games, ...
        It was a canvas that you could project your creativity onto. Yes, it was hard and somewhat niche. But it was personal. Everything was made by hobbyists and you could really see it.
        Nowadays, we have internet services. You wanna write a blog? Medium. You want to share videos? YouTube. Photos? Instagram. Music? ...ehh, the judge is still out on that one.
        This is great, because doing these things became a lot easier and opened possibilities to people no-one thought possible in the early 90s.
        However, there is a dark side. The works have lost most of their character. They're all accessible and easy to navigate, but very few make you go: "Wow. A human made this."
        We've lost that connection. Those moments of self-realization. That you're not just a cog in a machine - you're an artist. Everyone is.
        
        What completely ruined web services for me was their commercialization. A company creates a great web service, gets bought by a bigger company that doesn't give a shit and shuts everything down.
        All of your data, gone. I feel physical pain going through old forum posts and seeing thousands of dead image links. It feels like we lost a huge amount of internet history due to this. It sucks. I hate it.
        So from now on, my images, short URLs, music-
        Oh. Yeah, that's the other thing.

        THERE ARE NO GOOD MUSIC SHARING PLATOFMRS. ANYWHERE.

        Sure, there's SoundCloud, but that's more of a Spotify alternative. I need something to post my demos/song snippets to. I wanna share short links that let people listen to my music, on the broswer, without a fucking app
        or account. I want them to then be able to go to my profile, see my other music, see other versions of the song they've just listened to without having to jump through the many
        shit-stained hoops that kill indie music creators.
        So there oyu go, that's another project. I'll build it with Phoenix LiveView and release it as FOSS. Keep a lookout for music.isc.hm

        Okay that's it, no more secrets. Go away now.
