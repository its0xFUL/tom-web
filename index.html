        Alright, if you must know, there's going to be a bunch of stuff here soon-ish.
        E-mail is already set up. Next is installing NextCloud onto a used PC and pointing wad.isc.hm to it. Yes, it's a reference to DOOM. Because DOOM rules.
        I've also set up a URL shortener. The domain for it is sg.isc.hm (sg = slipgate)
        
        Why? What's the point to all this?

        Thing is, the internet is not what it used to be. People used to make stuff, code terribly looking (but all the more unique!) blogs, image galleries, flash games, ...
        It was a canvas that you could project your creativity onto. Yes, it was hard and somewhat niche. But it was personal. Everything was made by hobbyists and you could really see it.
        Nowadays, we have internet services. You wanna write a blog? Medium. You want to share videos? YouTube. Photos? Instagram. Music? ...ehh, the judge is still out on that one.
        This is great, because doing these things became a lot easier and opened possibilities to people no-one thought possible in the early 90s.
        However, there is a dark side. The works have lost most of their character. They're all accessible and easy to navigate, but very few make you go: "Wow. A human made this."
        We've lost that connection. Those moments of self-realization. That you're not just a cog in a machine - you're an artist. Everyone is.
        
        What completely ruined web services for me was their commercialization. A company creates a great web service, gets bought by a bigger company that doesn't give a shit and shuts everything down.
        All of your data, gone. I feel physical pain going through old forum posts and seeing thousands of dead image links. It feels like we lost a huge amount of internet history due to this. It sucks. I hate it.
        So from now on, my images, short URLs, music-
        Oh. Yeah, that's the other thing.

        THERE ARE NO GOOD MUSIC SHARING PLATOFMRS. ANYWHERE.

        Sure, there's SoundCloud, but that's more of a Spotify alternative. I need something to post my demos/song snippets to. I wanna share short links that let people listen to my music, on the browser, without a fucking app
        or account. I want them to then be able to go to my profile, see my other music, see other versions of the song they've just listened to without having to jump through the many shit-stained hoops that kill indie music creators.
        So there you go, that's another project. I'll build it with Phoenix LiveView and release it as FOSS. Keep a lookout for music.isc.hm

        All that said, this is it. The place for my family's online presence. Here we'll have our blogs, photos, games, music... whatever interests us. Some of it will be open to the public, most of it not.
        Unless the internet changes in a profound way for the next 3 generations, this will be our place on the internet. If I could buy this domain for the next 100 years, I would. But the HM registry doesn't let me.
        I already own the servers all of this is (and will be) running on. Aside from replacing the drives every few years (and paying for the internet service in our home), we should be set.

        Just for the love of all that is holy, don't revoke my domain, Australia. I know the penguins would love their own blogs too, but just let me keep this one? I'll help out with the US import taxes lol.
        If you don't know what I'm on about (or what the .hm in this domain even is), have a read: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heard_Island_and_McDonald_Islands
        Cool stuff!
